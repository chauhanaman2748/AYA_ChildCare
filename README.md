PROJECT NAME: AYA

OWNED AND DEVELOPED BY: Unnovate (the UWindsor IT Innovation company)

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
Technologies used: Flutter and Java
User Platform: Mobile Application

CONCEPT:
To take care of the baby and manage their work alongside, the family hires a baby care-taker or nanny, also known as Aya (as per Hindi language in India).

This is where our project name ‘AYA’ originates from.

The baby care-taker acts as an extra help for the parents by managing the baby’s daily needs like their diet plans, keeping a check of the baby's health, etc.

Thus, the parents across the globe have either already considered getting help of this type or are planning on getting one.

Similarly, the system that we have built will help the parent to take care of their baby.
